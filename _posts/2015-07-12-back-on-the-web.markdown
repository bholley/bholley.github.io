I've had a lot of websites over the years. The first one went live when I was eleven years old, and was admittedly much more about style than substance. That one was on Angelfire, the next on Tripod, then a Xanga, then self-hosted MovableType and WordPress. You can probably find them all of them archived somewhere if you try, but I won't disturb their slumber by linking to them here.

I didn't have much to say back then, but I sure went to great lengths to say it anyway. I have more to say now, but much more trouble finding the time to write it down. I racked up a grand total of nine posts over seven years on my [most recent blog](http://bholley.wordpress.com) with decreasing frequency. The more things I'm working on, the less often blogging bubbles up to the top of my list.

I'd like to change that. There's a backlog of stuff I'd like to write about, and I'm hoping that I can overcome the inertia that has foiled me in the past by keeping posts short and specific.

Here goes.

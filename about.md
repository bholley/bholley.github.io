Hi there! I'm Bobby Holley, a.k.a. :bholley. I build software.

![Head Shot](/images/headshot.jpg)

I started working on Firefox in 2008, and have been at it ever since. I know a lot about the Web Platform and care deeply about its future. My domains of expertise include security, the DOM, JS engine internals, multimedia playback, graphics, concurrency, and large-scale platform architecture. I like tackling hard problems, especially when things are on fire and impossibly broken. I like forging order out of chaos, and building things that last.

Email to get in touch.
